2. Write a class called LoanProcess with Loan_No, Customer Name, LoanAmount, EMI_Amount, Account_Balance as its members. Create a method calculate_EMI() for the LoanAmount , with the rate of interest as 13% for a total of 3 years and store it in the EMI_Amount. The rest of the information to be passed through constructors. Write another function CheckBalance() which checks if the Account_Balance is less than the EMI_AMount. If yes then throw a custom exception. Display " Not Sufficient Balance to repay Loan" in the finally. Give explanatory comments.
